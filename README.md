# AI-Programming-with-Python
These two projects are part of **AI Programming with Python** by **Udacity**. This course plays a crucial role in my understanding of the Python language and libraries such as NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
# Project 1 - Image Classification using Pretrained models
**Project Goal**

Image Classification using pretrained models for city wide dog show. 

**Project Overview**

A citywide dog show is being organized, and I have volunteered to assist with contestant registration. Participants must submit an image of their dog along with its biographical information. The registration system tags the images based on this information.
However, some participants may attempt to register pets that are not dogs. To ensure only dogs are allowed in the competition, I will use a pre-trained image classifier to verify each entry.

**Tasks & Learning Objectives**

Using Python, I will:

1. Evaluate different image classification models **AlexNet, VGG, ResNet** to determine which one best distinguishes between dogs and non-dogs.

2. Assess the accuracy of the best-performing model in correctly identifying dog breeds.

3. Measure and compare the execution time of different classification algorithms, understanding the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.
# Project 2 - Image Classifier for Flowers

In this project, I am building an image classifier capable of recognizing different flower species. This deep learning model can be integrated into applications, such as a mobile app that identifies flowers using a camera. The model will be trained using a dataset of 102 flower categories and later exported for use in real-world applications.

**Project Steps:**
1. Load and preprocess the dataset

2. Train a deep learning classifier

3. Use the trained model for image prediction
